## Homework

Here are some ideas to improve the application:

* Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects
* Add support for nicknames
* Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he presses enter.
* Add “{user} is typing” functionality
* Show who’s online
* Add private messaging
* Share your improvements!
